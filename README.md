## üéØ Target Deployment

* **Platform-Optimized:** Designed for deployment on Docker-native platforms like **Dokploy** and **Coolify**, integrating smoothly with their Traefik-based environments.
* **Cloudflare:** Built to be fully proxied by **Cloudflare**, leveraging its CDN, WAF, and Zero Trust services for essential security and performance.

---

## ü•á Core Advantages

* **Multi-Layer Caching:** Cloudflare (Edge), NGINX + Rocket-NGINX (Static HTML), WP Rocket (Page), and Redis (Object).
* **Extreme Performance:** NGINX/Rocket-NGINX serve cached pages instantly, bypassing PHP execution.
* **Hardened Security:** Tuned NGINX configs (headers, rate limiting) plus Cloudflare's DDoS/WAF proxy.
* **Smart Automation:** Fast setup, auto-init scripts for MariaDB, and a reliable external cron system.
* **Docker-Ready:** Includes essential Must-Use plugins (like `wordpress-docker-bridge.php`) to fix loopbacks and ensure correct NGINX/Cloudflare integration.
* **Extra Tools:** Adminer and File Browser to manage files and database.

## üö¶ Quick Start

### Local Development
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```zsh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd wp-docker-turbostack
   ```
2. **Start local stack**
   ```zsh
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
   ./scripts/setup-mariadb.sh  # Configure database
   ```

### Production Deploy
1. **Upload to your Docker platform** (Dokploy, Coolify, etc.)
2. **Configure environment variables** (see below)
3. **Start stack**
   ```zsh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

## üåê Access URLs

**Local Development:**
- WordPress: http://localhost (Nginx with FastCGI Cache)
- Adminer: http://localhost:8081
- File Browser: http://localhost:8082 (check logs for password)

**Production:**
- WordPress: https://yourdomain.com
- Adminer: https://adminer.yourdomain.com (BasicAuth required)
- Files: https://files.yourdomain.com (BasicAuth required)

---

## ‚è∞ WordPress Cron

WordPress cron is **DISABLED** for performance (doesn't run on every visit).

# Add to system crontab (every 3 hours)
0 */3 * * * /usr/local/bin/wp-cron-external.sh >> /var/log/wp-cron.log 2>&1
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Configuration

Set these in your `.env` file:

```env
# Database Settings (CHANGE ALL PASSWORDS)
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your-root-password-here
MYSQL_DATABASE=wp-site
MYSQL_USER=wp-user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your-password-here

# Extra settings
TZ=your-timezone
```

---

## üìù Usage & Best Practices

- **`.env` Setup:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all secrets. Never commit `.env` to version control.
- **Cloudflare Integration:** This stack is designed to run with Cloudflare. Always enable the **Cloudflare Proxy** (orange-cloud) for performance, caching, and to activate the **WAF** for threat protection.
- **Secure Access (Zero Trust):** Use **Cloudflare Zero Trust** to protect all sensitive login pages. This is the recommended method for securing `wp-admin`, **Adminer**, and **File Browser** instead of exposing them to the public internet or relying on Basic Auth.
- **Local vs. Production:** Use `docker-compose.local.yml` for local development only (e.g., `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up`). Never use local overrides in production.
- **Must-Use Plugins:** The auto-mounted plugins (`turbostack-optimizations.php`, `wordpress-docker-bridge.php`) are critical for performance, security, and a correct Docker/Cloudflare/NGINX integration.
- **Volumes:** All persistent data (DB, uploads, configs) is stored in named Docker volumes. Ensure you have a regular backup strategy for them.

## üßÆ Resources adjustments

This stack is pre-configured with optimized resource limits to enable deploying multiple WordPress sites on a single server. Adjust resource values in docker-compose.yml to match your host's capacity.
